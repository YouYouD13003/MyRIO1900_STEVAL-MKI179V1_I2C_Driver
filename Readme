ABBES Ayoub FPGA project 

in this repository you'll find the FPGA project , you should only take into consideration the vi's and subvi's labeled as ''version final fpga project'' . 
Moreover ,  It's important to note that 'read 4 bytes.vi' and 'read data subvi' are outdated and should be ignored. 
Instead, use 'read 4bytes(SubVI)' and 'read data 1 (SubVI)' which are the updated versions included in this project. 

You'll also find in a comprehensive report in PDF format.

If you have any questions or encounter any problems, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at ayoub.abbes@isen.yncrea.fr



Just a Friendly remainder :
please only consider the following Vi's and Subvi's for version final fpga project:

ack (SubVI) , adress register (SubVI) , Nack (SubVI)  , read 4bytes(SubVI)   , read data 1  (SubVI) , read dummy register accelerometer ,
